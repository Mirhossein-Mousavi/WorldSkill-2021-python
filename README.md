### Worldskills 2021 Image Processing code

* In one part of the competition, the robot ðŸ¤–  must be able to scan a table and understand the coordinates of colored squares ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¦.

* This code processes the camera image and stores the coordinates and colors of the colored squares in a list

### Example table :
<br>
<div align="center">

</div>  


* This code must recognize the difference between the background color and the blocks to run. In this program, it can be detected by clicking on the background color, but this process can be automated with very minor changes.
